## If You Get Stuck

**Issue**: "Can't add ALIAS at root"
- **Solution**: Some registrars call it ANAME or Virtual CNAME - use that instead

**Issue**: "CNAME conflicts with existing records"
- **For www and api**: This shouldn't happen - they're new subdomains
- **For @**: Use ALIAS specifically to avoid this

**Issue**: "Don't see ALIAS option"
- **Contact Squarespace support** - they should have this feature for domains with MX records

---

## Timeline

- **Add records**: 5-10 minutes
- **DNS propagation**: 15-30 minutes (up to 2 hours)
- **CloudFront activation**: Already deploying (5-15 minutes)
- **Total time to live site**: 30-60 minutes after adding records
